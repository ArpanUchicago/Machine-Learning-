1. Collaborative Filtering

Use this user-item matrix to:

A. Recommend 10 songs to users who have listened to 'u2' and 'pink floyd'. Use item-item collaborative filtering to find songs that are similar using spatial distance with cosine. Since this measures the distance you need to subtract from 1 to get similarity as shown below.
